# Introduction to TypeScript for JavaScript developers


### Learning TypeScript Samples

`npm install` to install pre-requisite dependencies.

`npm run-script tsc` builds JavaScript files from the examples.

`node 01-types` runs the first example.

`npm run-script tsc:w` builds and watches, useful for commenting/uncommenting code to walk through the example.

`npm run-script tsc:es6` builds for ECMAScript 2015 to illustrate differences in output despite the same TypeScript source.

### Project

The `project` folder contains a very simple web project that uses TypeScript.
